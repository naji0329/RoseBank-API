## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment by running `py -m venv env`.
2. Activate the virtual environment by running `source env/bin/activate` (on Mac/Linux) or `.\env\Scripts\activate` (on Windows).
3. Install all project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Generate the database migration files by running `py manage.py makemigrations`.
5. Apply the database migrations by running `py manage.py migrate`.
6. Start the development server by running `py manage.py runserver 80`.

Note: If you're using Windows PowerShell, you may need to set the execution policy by running `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` before activating the virtual environment.

## Code Documentation

The given code consists of two parts: a custom renderer class named UserRenderer and a view class named UserPasswordResetView.

### UserRenderer

The UserRenderer class is a subclass of JSONRenderer from the rest_framework module. It is used to customize the rendering behavior for the response data in JSON format.

#### Properties

charset: This property sets the character encoding for the response to utf-8.

#### Methods

render(self, data, accepted_media_type=None, renderer_context=None): This method is responsible for rendering the response data. It takes three parameters:

- data: The data to be rendered.

- accepted_media_type: The media type accepted by the renderer.

- renderer_context: The context passed to the renderer.

The render method checks if the data contains an ErrorDetail object. If it does, it creates a JSON response dictionary with the key 'errors' and the data as its value. If the data does not contain an ErrorDetail object, it creates a JSON response using the data as is. The method then returns the JSON response.

### UserPasswordResetView

The UserPasswordResetView class is a view class that handles the password reset functionality.

#### Properties

renderer_classes: This property is a list that specifies the renderer classes to be used for rendering the response. In this case, it contains a single entry UserRenderer, which indicates that the UserRenderer class should be used to render the response.

#### Methods

post(self, request, format=None): This method handles the HTTP POST request for password reset. It takes two parameters:

- request: The HTTP request object.

- format: The format of the response data.

Inside the post method, a UserPasswordResetSerializer is instantiated with the request data and the request context. The serializer is then validated, raising an exception if it is not valid. Finally, a response dictionary with the key 'message' and the value 'Password Reset Successfully' is returned with a status code of HTTP_200_OK.

This code demonstrates the use of a custom renderer class and a view class in the Django REST framework to handle password reset functionality.
